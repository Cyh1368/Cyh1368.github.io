      "summary": "(In press.) In this research, membership ratios of RR Lyrae (RRL) stars in 20 globular clusters are calculated, and their correlation with cluster properties is highlighted. It is concluded that three factors play an essential role in deciding the ratio of RRL variables to the number of stars in the home cluster, which are the cluster age, cluster radius, and metallicity, listed in order of descending impact. It is hypothesized that the formation of RRL stars is correlated with tidal forces and properties of the home galaxy."
