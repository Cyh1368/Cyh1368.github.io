Hi there! I'm Cheng-You Ho (何承祐), a high school senior based in Chiayi City, Taiwan, with a passion for **Physics** and a deep curiosity about the universe. Over the years, I've competed in multiple Olympiads and earned science fair awards in for my **Astrophysics** work on stellar evolution. Currently, I'm delving into **dark matter research**, focusing on the intriguing core & cusp problem.

In 2021, I founded **Delta Knowledge**, an educational social media platform dedicated to sharing science. Through our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@deltaknowledge15) and [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/deltakphy/), I aim to make complex scientific concepts accessible and engaging for everyone.

Beyond academics, I enjoy expressing myself through **music composition**, **video editing** (content creation), and playing **basketball**. Feel free to explore my page and connect with me!

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
