Hi there! I'm Cheng-You Ho (何承祐), a Yale freshman grown up in Chiayi City, Taiwan, with a passion for **physics** and a deep curiosity about the universe. Over the years, I've competed in multiple Olympiads and earned science fair awards in for my **astrophysics** work. I have done research on [stellar evolution](https://cyh1368.github.io/publications/), dark matter, carbon capture, etc. 

I enjoy expressing myself through **music**, **drawing**, **content creation** ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@deltaknowledge15) & [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/deltakphy/)), playing **basketball and table tennis**. Feel free to connect with me!

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
