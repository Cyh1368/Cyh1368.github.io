# In short...
Delta Knowledge is my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@deltaknowledge15) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/deltakphy/) platform dedicated to making science accessible and inspiring. Since its launch in 2022, I’ve led a team of four in creating engaging Instagram posts, producing high-quality videos, and hosting a design competition that successfully attracted sponsors. With our growing success, I’m excited to inspire even more people to join us on this journey of discovery and passion for science.

# Summary
 In 2022, I launched the YouTube channel "Delta Knowledge" to inspire change
 ("Delta") in viewers' understanding through engaging science videos. Initially, I
 taught physics concepts using my iPad, drawing on knowledge from
 undergraduate textbooks and my physics Olympiad preparation. Later, I
 adopted PowerPoint animations to explain ideas more effectively. In spring
 2024, 3 friends joined the team, and we expanded to Instagram, designing
 science infographics (posts) to share knowledge. Our content now spans topics
 from physics, astronomy, to earth science and real-world events like the recent
 earthquakes in Taiwan. This summer, we organized an infographics design
 challenge, inviting audiences to create science posts. The event attracted
 nationwide sponsors and successfully built a community among the
 participants. The channel now has 12k+ followers and over 6 million views
 combined across platforms. Moving forward, I aim to design more science
 content of various forms on multiple platforms and host similar initiatives,
 inspiring even more people to join us in the pursuit of science.
