# In Short...
After an intensive selection process during summer 2022, I was selected as one of 6 national representatives for the International Junior Science Olympiad (IJSO) at Bogota, Colombia. Devoting many weekends to preparing for the competition was finally worth it when I stood on stage, holding the flag with a silver medal around my neck.
